# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project is a showcase of the application of the precourse work provided to show a functioning website. the motivation of the project was a caffeine fuled rage due to delays caused from outside sources causing the project to be completed within a 24 hours time frame (i hate my job). the problem solved through this project is to create a clean and efficient way to store and review the information learnt throughtout the precourse material to help understand and showcase the knowledge we have learnt and will be learning. throught the precourse period we have gained a functional level of knowledge in JavaScript, Git, CSS, HTML and have applied them to create a practical website aswell as a functional showcase of our knowledge.
